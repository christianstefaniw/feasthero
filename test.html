<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diona is the founder of Tita Flips, her catering company and Kanto, her restaurant. Diona&rsquo;s mission to mainstream Filipino food has led to media appearances on the Food Network and CTV, and made Tita Flips a mainstay at cultural events like Taste of Manila, TO Food Fest and the KULTURA Filipino Arts Festival.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Diona will be one of the chefs who leads FeastHero&rsquo;s cooking classes. Her drive to be the first to try and successfully execute new concepts and her passion to bring innovative, Filipino street food to Toronto has played a critical role in her success.</span></p>
<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>Tell me about yourself and your company Tita Flips</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started cooking because it is a passion of mine. I started cooking for friends and family around ten years ago. One day, one of my friends asked if I catered and although I didn&rsquo;t at the time, I told them I did and was introduced to this new pathway. I spent most of my early career saying yes to everyone&rsquo;s requests and exploring all the new challenges and opportunities it came with. They would ask &ldquo;Do you do this?&rdquo; and I&rsquo;d respond, &ldquo;Of course we do that!&rdquo; even if at the moment, we didn&rsquo;t. That&rsquo;s how I became more well-known in the community.</span></p>
<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>How did you turn your cooking business into a career?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I felt like at that time there wasn&rsquo;t much representation for Filipino food and culture so I wanted to bring it to Toronto. Then, in 2007 the first shipping container market was created, the 707 Market. I was interested so I applied for a space. At the time there were 47 people in front of me on the waitlist. I filled it out with a made up concept - elevated street food. There was no street food in Toronto back then other than hot dog carts, and I missed the feeling of the bustling vendors from the street markets in the Philippines.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>When were you first introduced to cooking?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;ve always liked cooking. Since I was little, I watched my mom and aunts cook, so naturally I got involved in the kitchen. I loved trying new foods, so when there was a dish I liked, I tried to recreate it or make my own version of it. I think that is what helped me develop my cooking skills.</span></p>
<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>What&rsquo;s your favourite childhood culinary memory?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My mom was in the food business for specialty products, peanuts, and I remember, even at the age of seven, I was very particular about the quality. It was funny because even as a tiny girl, I was not afraid to reprimand the workers if they cut corners. I would tell them exactly how each step should be done and ensure the final product was up to my standards. That&rsquo;s where I got to explore and learn the importance of quality.</span></p>
<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>Why did you join FeastHero as chef?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a different platform to explore and I noticed no one was doing it in the Filipino community so I wanted to try it. I did a couple corporate classes before FeastHero and enjoyed it. It&rsquo;s really rewarding to pass on my cooking knowledge and see someone else use that to make the dish for the first time. They have a big smile on their face because they&rsquo;re so proud of themselves and I&rsquo;m so proud of them. FeastHero is great for me to have more of these experiences.</span></p>
<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>What are you most looking forward to at FeastHero?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&rsquo;m excited to meet new people, faces, even if it&rsquo;s not in person, I still love interacting with them. When you spend an hour with a group of people and you cook with them, it's a great bonding experience.</span></p>
<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>How do you think cooking bonds people?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When there&rsquo;s a special event there&rsquo;s always food. When the family gets together there&rsquo;s always food. Food tells a story. Food feeds the soul.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>What&rsquo;s the cooking tip that you use most in your kitchen?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always sharpen your knife, let the knife do the work for you. Don&rsquo;t make things in the kitchen harder than they need to be.</span></p>
<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>What&rsquo;s one tip you have for those learning to cook, or being more comfortable in a kitchen?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Always taste your food and adjust to your preferred taste. If you are always tasting, you will become more familiar with different flavours and find flavour combinations that you like. Although there are recipes, I like to think that they just serve as a guideline for you to get creative and adjust to your own taste.</span></p>
<h4 class='mt-5'><strong>What&rsquo;s your favorite dish to make and why?</strong></h4>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It changes, but right now it&rsquo;s the miki bihon pancit noodles that I&rsquo;m teaching at FeastHero. I like noodles because every culture has their own-- even filipino cuisine has many varieties. This dish is so special to me because it looked complicated and daunting but it&rsquo;s actually not. That&rsquo;s why I wanted to share it on FeastHero, to show everyone that it is easy to make.</span></p>
